Classification
=====
## Use Cases and Requirements
Classification in Traffic Light Recognition is required for usecases involved with traffic light:
* Passing the intersection when traffic light is green
* Stopping at the intersection when traffic signal is red

For the details about related requirements, please refer to the [document for Perception stack](/design/Perception/Perception.md).

## Role

Classification module recognizes traffic signal status. Unique signal types are handled in LampState.msg definition.

## Input

| Input| Data Type| Topic|
|-|-|-|
| Cropped traffic light information | `autoware_perception_msgs::TrafficLightRoiArray.msg`|/perception/traffic_light_recognition/rois
|Camera | `sensor_msgs::Image`|/sensing/camera/*/image_raw|

## Output

| Output| Data Type| Output Component |Topic|
|----|-|-|-|
|Traffic signal status|`autoware_traffic_light_msgs::TrafficLightStateArray`|Planning|/perception/traffic_light_recognition/traffic_light_states|

## Design
This is our sample implementation for the Classification module.

Unique signals are handled in `autoware_traffic_light_msgs::LampState`. When requiring to detect local unique signals which are not defined here, need to add them in `autoware_traffic_light_msgs::LampState`.
